[Google Merchandise Store Dashboard (BigQuery, Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/empfu/viz/GoogleMerchandiseStoreDashboard_16651030161410/GoogleAnalyticsDashboard)
- Cleaned and transformed online behavior data (1.4-million records) in BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Used BigQuery to analyze Google Analytics data and to calculate Google Analytics metrics, got hit-level data nested in ga_sessions, exported BigQuery tables to Google Cloud Storage then downloaded to local drive.
- Built a dynamic dashboard with KPIs for acquisition, activation and retention, such as monthly or yearly traffic (total sessions, average pageviews, average duration on page) per source and per location, acquisition amounts per channel, and bounce rate per page. Applied filters and parameters accordingly for segmentation and comparison analysis.

[Toronto Neighbourhood Rating Tools (Power BI, Power Automation)](https://github.com/empfudata/Projects/tree/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Toronto%20Neighbourhood%20Rating%20Tools)
-	Cleaned and processed open-source dataset using Power Query. Created calculated measures and calculated columns with DAX to analyze aggregated values in the dataset.
- Transposed and merged queries to re-organized dataset. Used DAX functions to calculate weighted average score based on different criteria and rank the neighbourhood using RankX.
- Created a cloud flow to automate a Survey-to-Rank Neighbourhood Rating tool with 365 Automation. Based on the rating analysis, with dynamic ratings generated from online form, the rating report ranked Toronto’s neighbourhood based on survey results.
